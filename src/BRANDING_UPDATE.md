## Visual Identity

### Logo

Current implementation uses Lightbulb icon from Lucide React.

The logo features gradient background from Deep Blue via AI Purple to Match Cyan. Width and height are 48px on desktop and 44px on mobile. It has a rounded-xl border radius. Shadow and glow effects appear on hover. The icon is white colored at 24px size.

Future custom logo design is planned maintaining gradient theme and lightbulb or zen concept.

### Color System

The authoritative semantic color system uses color only to communicate meaning, never decoration.

Deep Blue #1F3C88 represents trust, structure, and authority. It is used for primary headings, main CTAs, navigation, and structural elements. Hover state is #1A3273 and soft variant is #EEF2FF.

AI Purple #7C6CF6 represents intelligence, reasoning, and AI features. It is used for AI reasoning sections, smart features, and intelligence indicators. Hover state is #6959E6 and soft variant is #F3F1FF.

Success Green #22C55E represents confidence, feasibility, and positive outcomes. It is used for feasibility indicators, success states, and skill outcomes. Soft variant is #EAFBF1 and border is #86EFAC.

Match Cyan #22D3EE represents personalization and user-specific content. It is used for personalized features, recommendations, and match indicators. Soft variant is #ECFEFF and border is #67E8F9.

Guidance Yellow #FACC15 represents tips, reassurance, and helpful guidance. It is used for tooltips, helper text, and reassurance messages. Soft variant is #FFFBEB and border is #FDE68A.

This creates clarity where users understand color meanings, consistency with same meanings throughout, professionalism without random design, and accessibility where color enhances but isn't required.

### Typography

Clean readable fonts maintain proper hierarchy. Generous spacing improves readability. Responsive sizes adapt to screen size. Font weight of 500 is used for headings and 400 for body text.

### Visual Effects

Glassmorphism creates frosted glass navbar with backdrop blur and semi-transparent layered backgrounds.

Gradients include brand gradient from Deep Blue to Match Cyan, AI gradient from AI Purple to Match Cyan, and subtle purposeful gradients throughout.

Animations feature hover lift effects on cards, glow effects on hover, pulse animations for AI status, smooth 200-300ms transitions, and fade-in animations for new content.

Effects include logo glow on hover, shine effect on CTA buttons, dual pulse on AI Ready badges, shadow elevations, and border animations.
